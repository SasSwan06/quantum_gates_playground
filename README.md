# Quantum Gates Playground

An interactive Streamlit-based simulator that lets you visualize quantum gate operations on a single qubit — and learn about quantum computing concepts along the way.

---

## What This Project Is

This is not just a simulator — it's a **hands-on learning tool** for beginners in quantum computing. Choose a qubit state, apply quantum gates like Hadamard, Pauli-X, or phase gates, and watch how your qubit transforms on the Bloch sphere.

---

## Features

-  Choose an initial qubit state
-  Apply gates like H, X, Z, S, T, etc.
-  Visualize qubit state changes on a Bloch sphere
-  Get educational insights into what each gate does
-  Try suggested gate combinations and understand the outcomes

---

## Tech Stack

- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) — UI and interaction
- [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) — Quantum simulation and Bloch vector math
- [Matplotlib / Plotly] — For Bloch sphere rendering

## Learn as You Explore
This app will gently guide you to learn:

- What each gate does geometrically
- How Bloch sphere rotations relate to gates
- What the trannsformations look like mathemcatically.


## Educational Goals
This tool was created to:

- Be a lightweight introduction to quantum gates and transformations.
- Help students and enthusiasts develop geometric intuition
- Make exploring quantum concepts fun and interactive


## Contributing
PRs, feedback, and feature ideas are welcome! Being a beginner myself, I'd especially appreciate suggestions to make the explanations clearer or more accurate.
Please open an issue if you'd like to collaborate or improve the educational material; my goal is to make the app as educational as possible and I am open to feedback that will help me with the same.
